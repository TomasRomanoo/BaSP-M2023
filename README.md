## Week 02
During the second week, we focused on creating the HTML structure for our web page. We made sure to follow best practices for semantic markup and distributed our content appropriately across the page. To manage version control and collaborate with others, we utilized Git to save and track our changes. Finally, we leveraged GitHub to share our project with others and receive feedback.

## Week 03
During the third week, we focused on styling our HTML using basic CSS to improve our skills in designing and laying out a web page. Throughout the week, we learned how to apply color and background styles to elements, as well as how to use basic positioning to arrange them on the page. Additionally, we discovered how to link our HTML with an external CSS file, allowing us to separate our content and presentation layers for easier management and maintenance. By the end of the week, we had solidified our understanding of the fundamentals of CSS and were able to create visually appealing and well-structured web pages.

## Week 04
This week, I utilized Flexbox to create a versatile and adaptable layout for my web page. Flexbox allowed me to conveniently arrange page elements in rows or columns, effortlessly adjust their size and alignment, and easily modify their order when necessary. Using Flexbox resulted in a responsive design that seamlessly adjusted to various screen sizes and devices without requiring complicated or convoluted layout structures. Overall, Flexbox proved to be a powerful and efficient tool for achieving a modern and sleek design on my web page.

## Week 05
I practiced various essential concepts in JavaScript, such as variables, strings, arrays, if-else statements, for loops, and functions. I used variables to store and manipulate data, strings to modify text, and arrays to organize data into lists. To make decisions based on specific conditions, I employed if-else statements, and to perform repetitive tasks or iterate over arrays, I used for loops. Moreover, I learned how to optimize and organize my code effectively by implementing reusable and modular functions. Overall, this practice provided me with a solid foundation in JavaScript, and I gained practical experience in creating functional and dynamic programs.

## Week 06
This week, we utilized JavaScript to validate a login and registration form by implementing conditionals, loops, and modular functions. Additionally, we leveraged DOM manipulation to access input values and dynamically inject HTML and CSS to display error messages.

## Week 07
During this week, we implemented data validation for an endpoint using fetch and asynchronous promises. We passed input information through the URL using query parameters. Additionally, we added the functionality to store data in local memory with localStorage, which allows the client to save time when entering previously validated data.
